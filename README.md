# Student Check-in App

A beginner-friendly Java Swing + SQLite application that allows students to
anonymously share how they are doing in college.

## Why I built this
This is my **first Java GUI project**.
I used **ChatGPT as a learning assistant**, not to blindly copy,
but to understand how GUI, events, and databases work together.

I’m sharing this to get **honest feedback and improvement suggestions**.

## How to run
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Make sure `sqlite-jdbc` is added
3. Run `StudentCheckInGUI.java`

## Feedback
Please feel free to suggest:
- UI improvements
- Better database design
- Code structure improvements
